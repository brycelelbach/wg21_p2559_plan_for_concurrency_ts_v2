# Introduction # {#introduction}

We've been slowly filling the Concurrency Technical Specification (TS) version
  2 for approximately six years.
It's time to move this work to publication so we can get field experience with
  the contents of the TS.

# Scope # {#scope}

The following content is already in the Concurrency TS v2 Working Draft
  [[N4895]]:

* [[P1121R3]]: Hazard Pointers
* [[P1122R4]]: Read-Copy-Update (RCU) Data Structures

We should apply the following papers to the Concurrency TS v2 Working Draft
  [[N4895]] and then publish it:

* [[P0290R2]]: `synchronized_value`
* [[P1478R7]]: Byte-wise Atomic `memcpy`
* [[P2396R0]]: Concurrency TS 2 Fixes
* [[P1202R4]]: Asymmetric Fences

# Timeline # {#timeline}

* 2022-2H: Complete Concurrency and Library Evolution review of all Concurrency
    TS v2 content.
* 2023-1H: Complete Library review of all Concurrency TS v2 content.
* 2023-2H: Publish the Concurrency TS v2.

# Changelog # {#changelog}

* R0: Initial proposal.
* R1: Updated to the scope approved by the Concurrency and Parallelism Study
    Group and Library Evolution.
