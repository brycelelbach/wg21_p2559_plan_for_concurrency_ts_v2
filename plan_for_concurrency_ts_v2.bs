# Introduction # {#introduction}

We've been slowly filling the Concurrency Technical Specification (TS) version
  2 for approximately six years.
It's time to move this work to publication so we can get field experience with
  the contents of the TS.

# Scope # {#scope}

* [[P1121R3]]: Hazard Pointers

The following content has been approved by the Concurrency and Library Evolution
  groups for the Concurrency TS v2 and is awaiting Library review:
